      <h3>What is medical marijuana?</h3>
      <p>
        Medical marijuana uses the marijuana plant or chemicals in it to treat
        diseases or conditions. It's basically the same product as recreational
        marijuana, but it's taken for medical purposes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The marijuana plant contains more than 100 different chemicals called
        cannabinoids. Each one has a different effect on the body.
        Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the main
        chemicals used in medicine. THC also produces the "high" people feel
        when they smoke marijuana or eat foods containing it.

      <h3>How does it help?</h3>
      <p>
        Cannabinoids -- the active chemicals in medical marijuana -- are similar
        to chemicals the body makes that are involved in appetite, memory,
        movement, and pain.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>Research suggests cannabinoids might:</p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>Reduce anxiety</li>
        <li>Reduce inflammation and relieve pain</li>
        <li>Control nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy</li>
        <li>Kill cancer cells and slow tumor growth</li>
        <li>Relax tight muscles in people with MS</li>
        <li>
          Stimulate appetite and improve weight gain in people with cancer and
          AIDS
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Can medical marijuana help with seizure disorders?</h3>
      <p>
        Medical marijuana received a lot of attention a few years ago when
        parents said that a special form of the drug helped control seizures in
        their children. The FDA recently approved Epidiolex, which is made from
        CBD, as a therapy for people with very severe or hard-to-treat seizures.
        In studies, some people had a dramatic drop in seizures after taking
        this drug.

      <h3>How do you get medical marijuana?</h3>
      <p>
        To get medical marijuana, you need a written recommendation from a
        licensed doctor in states where that is legal. (Not every doctor is
        willing to recommend medical marijuana for their patients.) You must
        have a condition that qualifies for medical marijuana use. Each state
        has its own list of qualifying conditions. Your state may also require
        you to get a medical marijuana ID card. Once you have that card, you can
        buy medical marijuana at a store called a dispensary.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>How do you take it?</h3>
      <p>To take medical marijuana, you can:</p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>Smoke it</li>
        <li>
          Inhale it through a device called a vaporizer that turns it into a
          mist
        </li>
        <li>Eat it -- for example, in a brownie or lollipop</li>
        <li>Apply it to your skin in a lotion, spray, oil, or cream</li>
        <li>Place a few drops of a liquid under your tongue</li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <p>
        How you take it is up to you. Each method works differently in your
        body. "If you smoke or vaporize cannabis, you feel the effects very
        quickly," Bonn-Miller says. "If you eat it, it takes significantly
        longer. It can take 1 to 2 hours to experience the effects from edible
        products."
      </p>

      <h3>Has the FDA approved medical marijuana?</h3>
      <p>
        The FDA has approved two man-made cannabinoid medicines -- dronabinol
        (Marinol, Syndros) and nabilone (Cesamet) -- to treat nausea and
        vomiting from chemotherapy. The cannabidiol Epidiolex was approved in
        2018 for treating seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of
        epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h3>What are the side effects of medical marijuana?</h3>
      <p>Side effects that have been reported include:</p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>Bloodshot eyes</li>
        <li>Depression</li>
        <li>Dizziness</li>
        <li>Fast heartbeat</li>
        <li>Hallucinations</li>
        <li>Low blood pressure</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        The drug can also affect judgment and coordination, which could lead to
        accidents and injuries. When used during the teenage years when the
        brain is still developing, marijuana might affect IQ and mental
        function.
